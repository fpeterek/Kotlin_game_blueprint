# Kotlin_game_blueprint

Blueprint for a Kotlin game. Includes a window, a JPanel panel used to render everything and a jumping rectangle. Don't use (ever).

Use case: None
You can use it but I honestly advise against it.

A simple blueprint for a game in Kotlin in case I ever need it. Everything is rendered using a single JPanel and updated using a Swing timer.
